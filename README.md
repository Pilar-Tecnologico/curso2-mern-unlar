This is project for a College Course for the MERN Stack 
Particularly, this part is only with html and will be updated constantly with css, bootstrap and other stuff.


JavaScriptV2 is the last tree (and update) of the project i made some mistake when putting the hrefs so it doesnt work on the github.io but it does on the localhost.
So in that case, you are obligated to download the project if you want to check it out.
